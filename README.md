Welcome to this repository, where you will find two fascinating Prolog projects. The first one is a simple yet powerful sentence parser for the Italian language. It defines a basic grammar structure, allowing Prolog to recognize and validate sentences based on predefined rules for articles, nouns, adjectives, and verbs. By using a structured approach, it determines whether a given sentence is grammatically correct, helping to understand how natural language processing can be implemented in a logical programming paradigm. You can test it by providing different sentence structures and verifying if they are accepted by the parser.

The second project is an Italian-to-English translator, built using a simple dictionary-based approach. It maps individual words from Italian to English and processes entire sentences by breaking them down, translating each word, and reconstructing the phrase in English. While it does not handle complex grammatical transformations, it provides a basic yet effective demonstration of how Prolog can be used for language translation. You can experiment by entering Italian sentences and observing their translations into English.
