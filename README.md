Welcome to this repository, where you will find three fascinating Prolog projects that demonstrate the power of logic programming in different domains.

The first project is a sentence parser for the Italian language. It defines a basic grammar structure, allowing Prolog to recognize and validate sentences based on predefined rules for articles, nouns, adjectives, and verbs. By using a structured approach, it determines whether a given sentence is grammatically correct. This project provides a great introduction to natural language processing with Prolog, allowing you to experiment with different sentence structures and see how Prolog evaluates them.

The second project is an Italian-to-English translator, built using a simple dictionary-based approach. It translates words from Italian to English and processes entire sentences by breaking them down, translating each word, and reconstructing the phrase in English. While it does not handle complex grammatical transformations, it offers a basic yet effective demonstration of how Prolog can be used for language translation. You can try different Italian sentences and see their translations into English, making it an interesting application of logic programming in linguistics.

The third project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Prolog. This project allows two types of gameplay: an automated match where Prolog plays both sides, and an interactive mode where you can play against the computer. The game board is represented as a list of nine elements, and the game logic ensures that moves are valid, alternating turns between the player and the AI. It includes rules for detecting winning conditions, validating moves, and even an AI opponent that tries to block the player from winning. The interactive mode lets you play as X, entering board positions to make your moves, while the computer responds as O. The game provides a great example of how Prolog can be used for decision-making and game logic.
